# Customer-Churn-Prediction-in-the-Telecom-Sector
🧠 Problem Understanding
In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer churn—when a customer stops using a company’s services—is a major business challenge.
Acquiring new customers is expensive, so retaining existing ones is crucial for profitability.

This project aims to:

🔍 Predict which customers are most likely to churn
📊 Analyze key factors influencing churn
🛡️ Help telecom companies implement proactive retention strategies
📂 Dataset Overview
Rows: 3,333 customers
Features: 20 attributes + churn label
Target variable: Churn (1 = customer churned, 0 = retained)
No missing values ✅
Feature	Description
State	Customer’s state of residence
Account length	Duration of the customer account
Area code	Area code assigned to the customer
International plan	Whether the customer has an international plan
Voice mail plan	Whether the customer has a voicemail plan
Number vmail messages	Number of voicemail messages
Total day minutes	Total minutes used during the day
Total day charge	Charges for daytime usage
Total eve minutes	Total minutes used during evenings
Total eve charge	Charges for evening usage
Total night minutes	Total minutes used at night
Total night charge	Charges for night usage
Total intl minutes	Total international minutes
Total intl charge	Charges for international calls
Customer service calls	Number of calls to customer service
Churn	Target variable
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📊 Distribution analysis of numerical & categorical features
🔗 Correlation heatmap → highlight strongest predictors
📉 Churn imbalance: dataset is imbalanced, requiring strategies like resampling or model weighting
📦 Feature importance:
Total day charge → strong positive correlation with churn
Total day minutes → significant impact
Customer service calls → high churn when customers frequently call
⚙️ Data Preparation
Encoding categorical variables → One-hot encoding for State, International plan, and Voice mail plan
Standardization of numerical features
Train-test split: 80% train, 20% test
Addressing churn imbalance using stratified sampling
🤖 Modeling & Evaluation
We tested four models and evaluated them using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC.

Model	Accuracy	AUC	Precision (Churn)	Recall (Churn)	F1-Score (Churn)
Logistic Regression	77%	0.77	0.36	0.76	0.49
SVM	94%	0.82	0.86	0.65	0.74
Random Forest	96%	0.86	0.95	0.73	0.82
XGBoost ✅	96%	0.88	0.95	0.77	0.85
📌 Best Model → XGBoost 🎯

✅ Highest AUC → 0.88
✅ High F1-score for both classes
✅ Better generalization on unseen data
📌 Key Insights
Customers with an International Plan have a higher churn probability ⚠️
Frequent customer service calls are a strong churn indicator 📞
High daytime usage and charges correlate with churn 📊
XGBoost outperforms other models, making it the recommended choice ✅
